# Intro
This is a simple batch tensor addition example with Xilinx SDAccel and CMake.  
The targeted SDx version is 2019.1 but it also should work fine with 2018.3 without any modifications.

# Steps to...
The path to SDAccel platform file(*.xpfm) should be set to the environment variable `AWS_PLATFORM`.  
For configuring CMake and building the host program, run:
```
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```
then,
##### For Software Emulation:
```
make compile_swemu
make link_swemu
sh launch_swemu.sh
```
or  
```
sh autobuild_swemu.sh
sh launch_swemu.sh
```
##### For Hardware Emulation:
```
make compile_hwemu
make link_hwemu
sh launch_hwemu.sh
```
or  
```
sh autobuild_hwemu.sh
sh launch_hwemu.sh
```
##### For Hardware Execution(Real FPGA):
```
make compile_hw
make link_hw
sudo sh
source $XILINX_XRT/setup.sh
./MyHostExecutable
```
or  
```
sh autobuild_hw.sh
sudo sh
source $XILINX_XRT/setup.sh
./MyHostExecutable
```
# PasteBin Agent
In order to automate the building modes, the PasteBin agent is developed to automatically upload log files generated by XOCC during compilation and linking processes to PasteBin. Just make sure that it is enabled in the main CMakeLists.txt and username, password, and API key of your PasteBin account are set.
